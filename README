These are freenode-specific modules for atheme-services.

They are currently intended for atheme-services trunk,
hg clone http://hg.atheme-project.org/atheme

The ircd is hyperion as currently used by freenode (hyperion-1.0.2b(382)).

To compile, first compile and install atheme-services. Then copy
Makefile.config.example to Makefile.config and edit it, then make and make
install.

You can then load the modules using atheme.conf lines like
loadmodule "modules/freenode/regnotice.so";
loadmodule "modules/freenode/ns_extendchans.so";
loadmodule "modules/freenode/cs_access.so";
or the OperServ MODLOAD command.
