Help for REGAIN:

REGAIN disconnects an old user session, or somebody
attempting to use your nickname without authorization,
then changes your nickname to the given nickname.
This may not work, disconnecting you, if the target
client reconnects automatically.

If you are logged in to the nick's account, you need
not specify a password, otherwise you have to. In the
latter case, you will still have to identify later.

Syntax: REGAIN <nick> [password]

Example:
    /msg &nick& REGAIN foo bar
